     <h1>What is computer engineering?</h1>
        <p>The simple answer is computer engineering combines computer science with electronic engineering, which allows engineers to create hardware that works with computer networks. To get a clearer picture of what computer engineering consists of, a better question might be, what do computer engineers do exactly?

       Computer engineers design, create, and test computer hardware and software, analyze the results, and   update outdated equipment so that it’s ready to use with new software. Some engineers also oversee manufacturing and development processes, while others are more involved in testing software.</p>
        <h1>Job of a computer engineer</h1>
            <p>
        <strong>Computer engineers</strong> work to improve the capabilities of computers and find new ways to apply computers to other machines and systems. These engineers generally need knowledge of computer hardware and software and combine many concepts from the fields of electrical engineering and computer science. These engineers may work with computer hardware, software, computer architecture, programming, and computer-based systems.

Several different job titles, including computer hardware engineer, software engineer, and computer architect, could fall under computer engineering. While job duties may vary with the specific job title and area of specialty, in general, computer engineers may be responsible for:</p>
        <h1>Why is Computer Engineering Important?</h1>
        <p>Can you imagine a world without your smart phone? What about your laptop, fitbit, or video games? Using these devices has become a major part of our day-to-day lives and routines. As our need for the latest gadgets and technology increases, so does the demand for these professionals. But the labors of computer engineers aren’t just solutions for killing time. Many computer engineers receive specialized training to work in the field that interests them the most. Computer engineers interested in data integrity and protection help create data management systems, those interested in working for the military design embedded devices or supercomputers that create war simulations. There are also plenty of use cases in healthcare, including CAT scans, wearable devices, and robotics.

An engineer can be useful in almost any industry since their main function is helping things run efficiently, troubleshooting issues, and of course, problem solving.
</p>
            <h1>What are the basic qualification to became a computer engineer</h1>
       <p>Generally, a bachelor's degree is the minimum education required of a computer engineer. Most employers require students to hold a bachelor's degree in computer science, computer programming, computer engineering, computer information systems, electrical engineering, or a similar computer-related field. Employers have a strong preference for graduates with computer programming skills and a familiarity with a range of programming languages.

Taking an internship under the supervision of an experienced computer engineering professional is the best way to learn the skills and technical applications needed to be a computer engineer. Many internship programs are available for college credit in any given major. Internships offer hands-on experience to likewise inexperienced amateurs in the field. Most employers will not hire a computer engineer who does not have some relevant experience.</p>
